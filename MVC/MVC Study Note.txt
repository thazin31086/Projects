What is MVC ? 
-------------
 MVC is software architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components Model, View and Controller 
 Model - corresponds to all the data related logic that the user works. The data is being transferred between View, Controllers and components
 View - used of all the UI logic of the application 
 Contoller - controller act as interface between Model and View Components

Maintain State between a Controller
------------------------------------
 Below options can be used with MVC
  - ViewData 
  - ViewBag
  - TempData
  - Model


 ViewData and ViewBag are single server called (meaning value will be null if redirect occurs). To maintain state from once controller to another then tempData can be used

 ViewData and ViewBag serve the same purpose, View Data is dictionary object and require typecating and null checks. ViewBag is dynamic property that doesn't have typecasting and null check. ViewBag is dynamic time as it can introduce runtime error. 

What is ASP.NET MVC? 
--------------------

eg/

[NoAction]
public void MyNonActionMethod()
{

}
