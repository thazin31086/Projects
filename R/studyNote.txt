Standard deviation(S)
  calculation link :

  eg link http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-standard-deviation.html
- it measure how spread out data from the mean eg(math score varience, the higher no the bigger variance)


Type of Statistical Models 
- Probability Density Function - is a function, used to specify the probality of ramdon variable falling withing a particular range of values. 
- Analysis of variance - is a statistical method used to test the degress to which two ore more groups vary or differ in an experience. 
                     Eg, Null Hypothesis - mean no differences between groups and no significant results will be revealed
                         Alternative Hypothesis - difference between groups

- Simple linear regression  - statistical method to study relationships between two variable (x - independent variable(Explanatory variable), y - dependent variable(outcome))
                            - a straight line that attempts to predict the relationship between two points
                             - a regression line is one way of predicting information and finding a correlation in the data
