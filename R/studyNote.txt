Descriptive Statistics 
------------------------
are statistics that quantitatively describe or summarize features of a collection of information. 

Standard deviation(S)
  calculation link : 
  http://statistics.about.com/od/Formulas/a/Sum-Of-Squares-Formula-Shortcut.htm
  eg link http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-standard-deviation.html
- it measure how spread out data from the mean eg(math score varience, the higher no the bigger variance)


Type of Statistical Models 
- Probability Density Function - is a function, used to specify the probality of ramdon variable falling withing a particular range of values. 
- Analysis of variance - is a statistical method used to test the degress to which two ore more groups vary or differ in an experience. 
                     Eg, Null Hypothesis - mean no differences between groups and no significant results will be revealed
                         Alternative Hypothesis - difference between groups

- Simple linear regression  - statistical method to study relationships between two variable (x - independent variable(Explanatory variable), y - dependent variable(outcome))
                            - a straight line that attempts to predict the relationship between two points
                             - a regression line is one way of predicting information and finding a correlation in the data

              eg . temperature drop people put on more jacket
- Non-linear regression 
- Bayesian network

What is Machine Learning? 
 - It essentially captures the essence of what we're attempting to accomplish. 
 - It need large amount of data high-quality data to build accurate machine-learning models. 
 - All machine learning model are based on statiscs. It applied statistical methods and theory. 
 - As, it is similar to data mining and statisical modelling.
 - It used a training algorithm to estimate. 



What can machine learning do?
- Classification - it can predit the categorical values.
- Regression - linear regression 
- Clustering - trying to group flowers by similar sizes, shapes and colors, 
	      segmenting our customes into various groups based on demographics.
- Anomaly detection - detect they are abnormal. eg. detecting credit card fraud

Types of Machine Learning?
- Supervised Learning - add label as input using Classification and regression. 
		eg predicting a numeric value when we built our linear regression
- Unsupervised learning - find patterns in the data. eg. clustering
