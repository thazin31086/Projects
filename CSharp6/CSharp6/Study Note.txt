C# 6 
Layer Architecture 
===================

Layer architecture separates the application into logical components that are easier to create, change, extend 
and maintain. It make the code component easier to reuse

Unit Testing 
=============
Higher quality code, faster and easier debugging and they are repeatable over the life of the application. 

Namespace 
=========
  - Define the scope for a set of related objects
  - Using static is a new kind of using clause that lets you import static members of types directly to the scope

  eg 
	using system.console; 

	static void Main(string[] args)
		{
		  WriteLine("Type sth"); 
		  ReadLine();
		}

Modifier 
========
Public - can be seem and access by any method in your program 

Private - can be only used by methods in the same class


Word Captalization 
====================
camelCase - start with lower case 
PascalCase - start with upper case

Camel Case - Fields,Variables, parameters
PascalCase - Constants, Properties use pascalcase

Class
=====
- a class is a specification of a set of data and the operations that act upon the data.
- class is a reference type, it includes methods and properties. 
  An instance of a class is called object

- Class property type
   - Full Property - has backing variable 
	 eg 
	 private double income; 
	 public double Income { 
	  get {return name; } 
	  set {name = value; }
	 }


	  
   - Automactic Property - shorthand for Full Property. same process as full property but shorter syntax 
		public double Income { get; set; }
   - Read Only (get or set)
		  public double Income { get;}
			
   - Read only with Initiatlization 
			public double Income { get;} = "Jasmine";


- Method Overloading 
   can define method in the same name as long as 
	- they differ in no of para or/
	- type of para

	eg. 
	public double computeSalary(double start){}
	public double computeSalary(double start, double bonus){}
	public double computeSalary(double start, string level){}

 - Constutor 
	use to create object and initilize your object to its starting state
	has two types 
	 - Default Constuctor - no parameters. if you do not any constructor to your class. 
							Default constructor is provided for you.
	 - Constructor with parameters 
	eg 


Static Methods
==============

- Caller method do not need to instantiate the class to call the method. 
eg/
public class TempartureControl
	{
		public static double CelsiusToFahrenheit(string tempCelsius)
		{
			double celsius = Double.Parse(tempCelsius);
			double fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;
			return fahrenheit;
		}

   }

Caller method

double c = TempartureControl.FahrenheitToCelsius(ReadLine());



Inheritence 
===========

Create is-a relationship. 

eg, Dog is a Animal, Cat is a Animal

  Animal
	 |
 |	       |
Dog		  Cat

Derived class indicate base class with colon 

public class Animal {}

public class Dog : Animal {}

public class Cat : Animal {}

Containment 
===========
create has-a relationship 


Class can contain properties and fields
These case be build in or user defined type

Fields are used to support the private method of the class 
Properties are use to expose values to other classes

eg. Book has a tableofcontents index and discount methods
class Book {
  public TableofContents tableofContents{get;set;}
  public Index index {get;set;}
  public virtual double Discount();
}


Polymorphism 
=============

Poly means many, Morph mean form == taking many forms
- allow our classes and derived classes in many forms
- we implement polymorophism using method overriding. 
- we implement polymorophism using virtual and overridden methods
- Derived and base classes can be treated polymorophism. 
eg/
class Book { 
  public virtual double Discount();
}

Class Fiction : Book {
   public override double Discount(){
	  base.Discount(); 
	  //other work here
   }
}

Encapsulation 
===============
is a concept where each class should have a single area of responsibility.

Exception 
=============
is object . Base of System.Exception.
Call Stack : is the list of methods that called methods that called other methods
Exception unwind the call stack until it find exception handler
if cannot find exception handler, program crash
eg/ 
 int c = b / (a- b); //if a-b is zero than it crash 

Exception handler //Prevent the Crash
------------------
eg/
try{
int a = 1, b = 1;
int c = b / (a- b); //if a-b is zero than it crash 

}catch{
  Console.WriteLine("Oop, Attempts to divide by zero");
}

Collection 
===========
Array - Must declare size 
foreach - useful whne loop through all the collection 
List<T>, IList<T>
--------
eg/
IList<T> - is an Interface. You cannot initiate it directly
List<T> - is concrete class which implements IList<T>. 

It is good approach to use Ilist<T> in you public facing API

List<Person> people = new List<Person>();

Dictionary<K,V>
---------------
eg/
   Dictionary<string, Person> dic = new Dictionary<string, Person>();
   dic.Add("george", new Person { Name = "George W", Age = 55 });


Interface & Abstract
====================

Interface 
---------
is a contract.
has three parts: Interface class, Implementer class, Client Class that calls methods on the implementer


Abstract 
---------
Abstract class :
 - consist of abstract methods that must be overridden to create a concrete class.
 = abstract class cannot be instantiated. has at least one abstract method 

Concrete class:
  - a class  is template, specifies  the traits or data, specifies the behavior or operations
 - act as base to other classes  
 - can be initiated
 - cannot hae abstract methods


 Statement 
 =========

 Ternary operator (? :)
 ---------------
 - Shorthand if/else statement
 eg/ int bigger = x > y ? x: y; 
 - 

 Coalescing operator (??)
 --------------------

x  ?? 0 - mean x not null return x, if null return Zero.

Delegate
========
Delegate is reference to a method.
Usage
------
It is a great way to encapsulate the code. 
Eg, when you attached the delegate event to button, button does not nee to know what it does. 

LINQ - Language Integrated Query
=====
Operator -> Zip used to product sequence of results from two corresponding sequence.

Expression Bordies Properties 
==============================
eg/
public string FullName 
{
  get {return FirstName + " " + LastName};
}

Equal Syntax Shortcut
---------------------
public string FullName => FirstName + " " + LastName;


Boxing vs Unboxing 
===================
http://www.technologycrowds.com/2013/08/box-and-unboxing-in-aspnet_20.html
Boxing is the process of coverting value type to Object Type
Unboxing is the reverse process 

Boxing Eg/ 
int i; 
i = 78
Object o = i; 

Unboxing eg/ 
Int i; 
Object o; 
o =8; 
i = 0;

Why use : Sometime it is unavoidable in some cases. In below example function accept parameter by reference object. 
eg. 


public object CalculateSimpleInterest(re object principalAmount)
{
   return (2 * 5 (double)principalAmount)/100;
} 

object principalAmount = 1500.00; //Boxing
object SimpleInterest = (double)CalculateSimpleInterest(ref SimpleInterest);// Unboxing


Mutable(Can Change) vs Immutable(Cannot Change) 
================================================

Mutable
